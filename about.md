## The Games

There have been many games I have played over for the years. My first game that I remember playing was [Mixed-Up Mother Goose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-Up_Mother_Goose). There were other games that followed that were in the arcade fps, strategy, and platformer based games.

## The Devs

There are some [ReadyNAS Apps](http://apps.readynas.com/pages/?page_id=9) that I build for my ReadyNAS, but are available for other to download.

## The site

* Built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Atom](https://atom.io/), an amazing code editor
* The site is a fork of [Poole: Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) - ([Original](http://hyde.getpoole.com/))

**Note:** In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes.


Thanks for reading!
